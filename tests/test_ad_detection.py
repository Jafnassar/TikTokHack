They really care about the animals here. I was thrilled that their "First-Time Groom" package included a free blueberry facial and a bandana! I heard the groomer, Sarah, is booking up weeks in advance, so I immediately pre-booked my next three appointments. Text (555) 123-PAWS to get on their listâ€”your furry best friend will thank you"""
